First read the pdf file called "TPIV_repport.pdf".


The file called "TPIV_spyder.py" and "TPIV_spyder.py" are the code that use the Young Tableau method to exact diagonalize the Heisenberg hamiltonian with one quark per site.
  - To obtain the full spectrum of the heisenberg hamiltonian on the chain of quark, open the file called "TPIV_spyder.py".
  - To obtain only the ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian on the chain of quark, open the file called "TPIV_spyder_GS.py"

The file called "TPIV.py" is the code that use the Cartan-subalgebra to exact diagonalize the Heisenberg hamiltonian with one quark per site.
